This is an Arduino sketch file written in C/C++, specifically designed for the ESP8266 WiFi microcontroller. It uses:

ESP8266WiFi library to connect to Wi-Fi.

FirebaseArduino library to send sensor data to Firebase Realtime Database.

Ultrasonic sensor (using trigPin1 and echoPin1) to measure distance (e.g., to detect potholes, humps, etc.).

Analog sensor (connected to A0) to detect changes in road conditions.

Buzzer (on pin D7) as an alert mechanism.
